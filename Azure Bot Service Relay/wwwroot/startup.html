    <p>This page is just some "not so random" notes page for me, as I dont work with app services too often, to it
        reminds me how local dev vs publish to app service works. You can ignore this file.</p>
    <h3>launchSettings.json</h3>
    <p>This is for local development, it defines how the local web server will be launched, the security settings for
        it, the ports used and the mode of the application e.g. Development. This mode is used by other settings
        configuration to determien which app settings to use.
        i.e. appsettings.json is always used, but it will also use appsettings.Development.json, if the development mode
        in launchSettings is set to Development.
    </p>
    <h3>Local Development</h3>
    <p>To run locally you can either start from VS Code / Visual Studio, and use break points to debug, or you can build
        via command line and run e..g "dotnet build" will just compile the solution, or "dotnet watch run" will compile
        and run, but also dynamicaly recompile if you change code.</p>
    <h3>Publish to Azure App Service</h3>
    <p> - First you should compile the service for release and not debug i.e. command line is "dotnet build -c release".
        This will compile what is need in app service to bin/ver/release/</p>
    <p> - Recommendation: If you use publish instead of build, it will create a publish folder and add compiled solution
        into there, along with required .Net framework files for self contained exection "dotnet publish -c release -0
        ./publish". In my case the only difference was it added the startup.html page also. But this is good. This
        publish folder is what can be deployed to Azur App Service</p>
    <p>I used VS Code, added the Azure App Service Extension, and then chose to publish to App Service, and chose the
        publish folder created in step above. This ensures only the publish files are uploaded to the web app</p>
    <h3>Environment variables in Azure App Service</h3>
    <p>There are several settings which the application uses, which are set in the appsettings.json /
        appsettings.development.json / appsettings.production.json. When hosted in Azure App service, you can still use
        these files, but better practise to set them in the environment settings part of the Azure App service.</p>
    <p>When you do add settings in Azure App Service, and they are nested settings, you use __ between parent and child
    </p>
    <p>Here is list of settings, as they would appear in Azure App Service:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>CopilotStudio__BotName - friendly name of Copilot Studio agent / bot</li>
        <li>CopilotStudio__BotId - Copilot Studio bot id (get from URL of bot in designer)</li>
        <li>CopilotStudio__BotLocation - leave empty if US, otherwise set to "europe", or "india". This is for the
            DirectLine URL</li>
        <li>CopilotStudio__TenantId - get from Copilot Studio settings for agent/bot</li>
    </ul>
    <p>These are Azure App Service settings using by Bot Framework SDK:
        https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/bot-service/bot-builder-authentication?view=azure-bot-service-4.0&tabs=userassigned%2Caadv2%2Ccsharp
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>MicrosoftAppType - not required for local dev. I wanted the app to use a user-assigned managed identity, so
            set this to UserAssignedMSI</li>
        <li>MicrosoftAppId - not required for local dev. This is the client ID of the managed identity in my scenario
        </li>
        <li>MicrosoftAppPassword - not required for local dev. Not applicable if using managed identiy</li>
        <li>MicrosoftAppTenantId - not required for local dev. This is the tenant id of where app is running, get from
            Entra ID properties page</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Configuring Azure Bot Service to use this App Service</h3>
    <p>You create an Azure Bot service and then need to set some properties so it uses the app service created above:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Messaging EndPoint - this is the path to the app service e.g.
            https://appservicename.azurewebsites.net/api/messages</li>
        <li>Bot Type - in my case set to user assigne managed identity</li>
        <li>Microsoft App ID - in my case set to the id (clientid) of the user assigned managed identity of the app
            service</li>
        <li>App Tenant ID - This is the tenant id of where app is running, get from Entra ID properties page </li>
    </ul>
    <p>Idea - you could use NGROK or Azure Dev Tunnel to point the Messaging EndPoint to your local dev server, and use
        debugging, breakpoints etc,</p>
    <h3>Deployment files folder</h3>
    <p>These are deployment templates for the Azure App Service and the Azure Bot Service. These can be used if you want
        to provision these services using ARM templates and command line. These are originally from -
        https://github.com/microsoft/CopilotStudioSamples/tree/master/RelayBotSample/DeploymentTemplates</p>
        <h3>Enable logging in web app</h3>
        <p>If you edit web.config in app service, you can set stdoutLogEnabled="true", this will send all output in the app service e.g. console.writeline and log output to these log files</p>
